            <p>
            The world wide web back in the day used to be vastly
            different, you used to not be able to search something
            and get hits for it unless you were descriptive enough.
            The first people who worked towards making the search
            engine that we use now-a-days was Yahoo! Michael
            Moritz was the man who approached the gentleman who
            would be the ones who started Yahoo! These two would
            be checked out by Michael and would have to give him a sales pitch on Yahoo. They would become one of the first people to make money off of using the internet. Yahoo had
            been very hesitant to start spreading ads. They eventually decided to go for it, and it was an insane idea, as it made Yahoo take off like crazy. That was until Excite had come into the picture. Excite was the number one competitor for Yahoo as their search engine would find you things related to what you searched, very similarly to how search engines work now-a-days. Yahoo and Excite went for each other back and forth making things like email and site log-ins and copying each other to not fall behind. This is when Google came into the picture, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were the two individuals who founded Google. Google used a system that basically had pages track where you went next to find you relevant information.
