            <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
        <p>Amazon and eBay is one of the most common ways to use people's spare time. People use their time indulging in spending money online for themselves Jeff Bezos was the founder of amazon.com. Jeff’s priority starting out saying that books were the best thing to sell online, as there is no way a bookstore or library can have EVERY single book, but you can online. Pierre Omidyar was the founder of eBay Amazon.com’s soon to be biggest competitor in the market. However Pierre didn’t see the web as a way to make tons of money, he thought that the idea of a self posting web auction site would be really great to have out there. The internet sales took off so fast, To compare: Radio took 38 years for 50 million to use it, for T.V. it took 13 years, and it took the internet just 4 years to explode and reach massive amounts of use.

            Google came into the picture at this point trying to branch the web along during the dot com bubble era. And the person who tried to push google along was Vinod Khosla. He introduced the founders of google to the search engine Excite. (more info found on google's startup found on the “Internet Search Page”) the two founders of google sat down at a restaurant and talked with the co-founder of Excite to try and branch their ideas together to overtake Yahoo! as the leading search engine.Excite could have bought Google out for around 1 million dollars. Google is currently worth 200 million dollars.

            Intel was the company that first made silicon microchips for a computer, and they first said the power in them would double each new chip. And that leads to tremendous numbers in such a short time.
            <br>
            <img src="internet.jpg" alt="Internet Picture" style="width:450px;height:450px;">
            <img src="amazon.jpg" alt="Amazon" style="width:450px;height:450px;">
            </br>
            The first thing the engineers used the chips for was to program a way to make even denser chips and stronger chips. This process is self accelerating making it more and more effective at making better versions of itself. The connections of internet users grows exponentially. Two hosts have one connection, three hosts have three, four hosts has six, ten hosts have 45, 100 hosts have almost 5,000 connections. This is Moore's law of connections showing how a network grows so fast and so vastly.

            Amazon was at this point looked at as just an online book store, as this was its main attraction and main use. The owner tended to lower prices on books constantly to create more traffic to his site. He would sacrifice profits now to become a bigger company in the future, his motto was in three words, get big fast.

            Public key cryptography was founded by Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle. Public key cryptography allowed users of websites to safely send their information such as a credit card number to places like amazon and not get it stolen by unwanted people in the process.

            This caused eBay to need to step up their ways of getting things done and getting noticed by investors. So the founder of eBay went to Meg Whitman. eBay then opened up pitches to stock investors and stock markets, eBays attention and stocks jumped to an estimated value of nearly 2 billion dollars. However during this time Wall Street was still favoring amazon and amazons shares nearly doubled in the span of a few weeks, despite still lowering prices of things and lowering profit margins.  Around that same time the stock markets for just about any big website with a dot com attached to it’s shares skyrocketed. People who would sit at home all day and just buy and sell stocks were called daytraders, they basically ended up turning the stock market into a casino. They would buy stocks in the morning and sell them in the afternoon hoping the numbers would go up during the day so that they would net a profit.

            Philip Kaplan was one of the first people to  capitalize on the stock market not having a common ground website. In the superbowl of 2000 many many internet startup companies spent an average of 2,000,000 dollars on a 30 second spotlight on T.V. spending nearly 40 million stockholder money on this venture capital.
